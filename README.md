# Engineering Tool — Monorepo Layout

This repository has been restructured into isolated projects:

- host-extension: VS Code extension (TypeScript)
- drivers/dotnet-driver: .NET driver (C#)
- drivers/python-driver: Python driver
- drivers/node-driver: Node.js driver

Each subproject is self-contained; build and run from its directory.
